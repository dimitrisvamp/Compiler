# Compiler_For_Minimal++

## University Project
A project from Computer Science and Engineering department of the University of Ioannina (UOI).

## Description 
The project's goal is to compile minimal++ programming language into machine language that a computer can read. <br /> 
At the same time, this compiler can detect and report obvious errors that the programmer may have made during the coding process, even issuing warning messages.

## Uploaded Files
The compiler of minimal++ is uploaded as a ***final.py*** file.

The description and the grammar of minimal++ are also uploaded.
